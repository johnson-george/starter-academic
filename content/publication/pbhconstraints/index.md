abstract: We study how the constraints on the primordial black hole density arising from the extragalactic photon background are modified in the scenario that there exist extra large spatial dimensions. We find that though the overall magnitude of the constraints is not substantially different, the mass ranges to which they apply are, and for some choices of mass it is possible for the black holes to constitute the entirety of the dark matter.
