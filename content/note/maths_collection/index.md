I taught applied mathematics to first year undergraduates at Oxford during the 2020-2021 academic year. The focus of the first term was geometry and calculus, and I wrote a practice paper for the students to sit in January that covered this material. My aim was to set problems that involved little in the way of bookwork, and which required the application of the ideas of the course to unfamiliar scenarios.
