These are my solutions to the problems in Chapter 0 of Allen Hatcher's Algebraic Topology. Most questions I solved independently, although for some of the trickier problems I referred to answers on math.stackexchange.com. There are almost certainly several errors, and I would appreciate being notified of any mistakes spotted.
