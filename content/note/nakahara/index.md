Over the course of my PhD I worked my way through the first 12 chapters of Geometry, Topology and Physics by Mikio Nakahara. The book is my personal recommendation for any theoretical physicist wanting a modern and comprehensive overview of the main results of differential geometry and algebraic topology. There are, however, numerous typos and small errors, and I have made my best attempt to log them here.
