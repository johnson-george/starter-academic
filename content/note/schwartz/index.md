Matthew Schwartz keeps a list of corrections for QFT and the Standard Model on [the book's website](https://schwartzqft.fas.harvard.edu/corrections). I noticed very few errors from earlier parts of the book that were absent from this list, but in later chapters I found significantly more which hadn't been recorded. I have made my best attempt to log them here.
